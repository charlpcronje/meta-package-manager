        Before filling this feature request, double check your manager is missing from the [support
        matrix](https://github.com/kdeldycke/meta-package-manager#supported-package-managers-and-operations).


        If you are a developper, you can try to implement support yourself. [Check the contribution
        guide](https://kdeldycke.github.io/meta-package-manager/contributing.html) and propose a Pull Request.


        If you are not a developper, you can still help the project by documenting some of the package manager
        metadata below. And better: if you contibute some raw output of the package manager, the maintainers
        can try a blind implementation of the new manager.

## How-to add a new package manager

For now the easiest way to have new package managers supported is to:

1. Fork the project.
1. Identify an already implemented package manager that is similar to the new
   one youâ€™d like to add.
1. Duplicate its definition file from the
   {gh}`/managers subfolder <tree/main/meta_package_manager/managers>`.
1. Adapt the new file to the particularities of the new package manager:
   - Always use `--long-form-option` wherever you can to have self-documenting CLIs.
   - Add at least one capture of the CLI output in the docstring to help future maintainer.
   - Read the {doc}`/falsehoods` to anticipate edge-cases.
   - Read the implementation of the {py:class}`meta_package_manager.base.PackageManager` base class from which all definitions derives.
1. Fix the code until the unittests passes. Most metadata, format
   constraints and structure for new managers are enforced in the unittest suite. See the
   {doc}`/development` page for more technical details.
1. Submit a PR.
